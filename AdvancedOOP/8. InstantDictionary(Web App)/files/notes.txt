Overall web development is adding own attribute in frontend
and using them in backend interchangeably

just py is a framework we can build frontend using python
so that we can do full stack only with python script ðŸ˜Š

to add url to a function we can
1. jp.Route('/exe', func_name)
2. using decorator - @jp.SetRoute('/exe') top of the func

the styling of justpy classes uses tailwindcss library

the just py has all tag attributes same as HTML
you want just search HTML attributes and pass it in jp.tag()

important point

when splitting classes string make sure to leave a space before end of the string in above line
i.e
(.., classes = "border-color-400 ",
                      "text-color-500")

Don't leave a space in actions of classes like
classes= 'hover: bg-white' --> doesn't work

we use
hierarchy/tree workflow in just py to arrange elements in div container

In classes use 'border border-attr'
first border set it to true

We can't parallel run in just py as the port is static

For styling use class code of tailwind css

use debugger to find non-working or errors

we can create custom attribute inside any tags
and use it them for backend

if you want to add properties everytime you have to call it
hover:bg-white hover:text-color

if you want to take actions use event handler
we can't do everything with classes as it is only for styling
if classes doesn't work create event handler function

event handler func instance variable is predefined inside tags

Quasar Page is a webpage interface
which provides additional advanced components

As we are creating classes for each domain/exe
Think QuasarPage() class as visual page has HTML & CSS
and our class as Routing connecting to visual page
